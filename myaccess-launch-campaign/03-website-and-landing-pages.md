# Website Pages

We need a few pages to support the campaign. Nothing fancy.

---

## MyWeb Access overview page

The main landing spot. Where emails and LinkedIn point to.

**Structure:**

1. **Top section**
   - Headline: "Disabled user testing for agencies"
   - Subhead: Something like "We combine automated checks with paid disabled testers to make key journeys actually work"
   - Buttons: "Watch webinar" (or "Watch recording" later) + "Talk about a pilot"

2. **The problem**
   - "Technically accessible vs actually usable"
   - 2-3 real examples (donation, checkout, booking)

3. **How it works**
   - Simple 3-4 step flow
   - Use `HowItWorks.png`
   - Scoping → Testing → Report/Portal → Debrief

4. **What agencies get**
   - Stronger tenders
   - Clearer fixes for dev teams
   - Pricing that fits £5-15k projects
   - Social impact story

5. **About MyVision**
   - Short charity intro
   - Testers are paid

6. **CTAs**
   - Watch webinar / Talk to us

## What to watch

**High clicks, low registrations:** Simplify the page. Move "what you get" higher. Shorter form.

**Not scrolling:** First screen needs to be more specific. Use bullets.

**Confusing navigation:** Make sure MyWeb Access pages are easy to find in the main menu.
