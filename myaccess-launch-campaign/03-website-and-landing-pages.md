# Website & Landing Page Plan – MyAccess Launch

## 1. Role of the Website

The website supports the campaign by providing:

- A **home for the MyAccess narrative** (overview page).
- A **conversion point for webinar registrations** (landing page).
- A **reference point for the one-site pilot** (section or page).

Emails and LinkedIn posts should link back to these pages for more detail and to capture interest.

## 2. MyAccess Overview Page

### Purpose

Give visitors a clear, simple explanation of:

- The **problem** (guideline-compliant sites still failing disabled users).
- The **solution** (MyAccess disabled user testing + automation).
- The **benefit** for agencies and their clients.
- The **charity/social impact** angle.

### Suggested structure

1. **Hero section**
   - Headline: “Disabled user testing for agencies, run by a visual impairment charity.”
   - Subhead: “We combine automated checks with paid disabled testers to make key user journeys genuinely usable.”
   - CTA buttons:
     - “Watch our webinar” (later: “Watch the recording”).
     - “Talk to us about a pilot.”

2. **The problem**
   - Short description of “technically accessible vs actually usable”.
   - 2–3 real-life examples (donation, booking, checkout).

3. **How MyAccess works**
   - Simple 3–4 step diagram/summary (use `HowItWorks.png`):
     1. Scope key journeys.
     2. Run automated checks + disabled user tests.
     3. Deliver agency-ready reports via the portal.
     4. Support fixes with debrief and optional retests.

4. **For agencies**
   - Bullet benefits:
     - Stronger story in tenders.
     - Less guesswork for designers/devs.
     - Clear, fixed pricing for £5–15k builds.
     - Social impact story (paid disabled testers, funding MyVision services).

5. **Pilot section (short)**
   - “Start with one site” overview: what’s included, who it’s for.
   - CTA: “Book a discovery call.”

6. **About MyVision**
   - Short charity intro: history, mission, who you support.
   - Emphasis that disabled testers are **paid** for their work.

7. **Contact / CTA strip**
   - Repeated CTAs: “Talk to us”, “Watch the webinar”, “Email us”.

### Content suggestions

   - "One dashboard for all your accessibility insights"
   - Short description: View reports, track progress, export findings – all in one place.

2. **Key features (with screenshots if possible)**

   - **Dual report views:** Switch between stakeholder summary and developer detail
   - **Smart filtering:** Filter issues by severity, component, user journey, or WCAG criterion
   - **Export ready:** Download prioritised issue lists for Jira, Trello, Linear, or spreadsheets
   - **Progress tracking:** Mark issues as fixed and track remediation over time

3. **Who gets access**
   - Included in every pilot and ongoing engagement
   - One login per agency (can add team members)

4. **CTA**
   - "See the portal in action" → link to webinar or request a demo
   - "Start with a pilot" → booking link

### Suggested visuals
- Portal screenshot (if available) or mockup
- `HowItWorks.png` as supporting context

## 6. Troubleshooting & Things to Watch

### Metrics

- Page views (from email & LinkedIn).
- Time on page (are people reading or bouncing?).
- Conversion rate:
  - Overview → webinar registration.
  - Webinar registration → attendance.
  - Pilot page → booking/call requests.

### Common issues

1. **High clicks, low registrations**
   - Simplify copy (remove fluff above the fold).
   - Move key “what you’ll get” bullets higher.
   - Reduce the number of form fields.

2. **Visitors not scrolling**
   - Make the first screen more concrete (headlines, bullets, clearer problem statement).
   - Use subheads and whitespace to invite scanning.

3. **Confusing navigation**
   - Ensure MyAccess pages are easy to find from the main site menu.
   - Minimise distractions on webinar and pilot pages – keep CTAs focused.

## 7. Practical Tips

- Re-use the same language across emails, LinkedIn and pages so nothing feels disjointed.
- Add alt text and clear headings for accessibility.
- Add basic analytics/UTM to see which channels drive high-intent visitors.
