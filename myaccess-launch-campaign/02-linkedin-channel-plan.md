## LinkedIn Event

Create an Event for the webinar:
- Title matching webinar
- Date, time, timezone
- Short description
- Link to external registration

Invite 1st-degree connections who fit the target. Share in posts.

---

## DM outreach

Keep it short and human.

**Pre-webinar:**
> Hi {{name}}, I'm Mark from MyVision Oxfordshire. We've been helping agencies run disabled user testing on sites. Doing a free session in January on what disabled users find that tools miss – thought it might be relevant given your public sector work.

**Post-webinar (to attendees):**
> Thanks for joining the session. If you'd like to try this on one site, we're running a small number of pilots – happy to share details.

## If engagement is low

- Use more concrete stories, fewer abstract statements
- Ask questions ("Have you seen a site that passed checks but still didn't work?")
- Directly invite high-fit contacts to the Event
- Shorten DMs further
- Focus on what's in it for them
