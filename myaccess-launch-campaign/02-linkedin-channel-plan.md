# LinkedIn Plan – MyAccess Launch

## 1. Role of LinkedIn in the Campaign

LinkedIn is your primary **supporting channel** for:

- Reaching agency decision-makers where they already are.
- Reinforcing the same story as the email sequence.
- Driving additional **webinar registrations**.
- Building Mark’s and MyVision’s authority on accessibility and disabled user testing.

---

## 2. Content Themes by Phase

### Phase 1 – Awareness (Weeks 1–2)

Goal: Echo Email 1–3 themes in short, scannable posts.

**Post 1 – Story post (use `LooksVsReality.png`):**

> We recently watched a blind user try to donate on a site that had "passed" its accessibility checks.
>
> She found the donate button fine. But when the form loaded:
> - No labels were announced
> - The "amount" field read as "edit blank"
> - The submit button said "button" with no context
>
> She gave up after 4 minutes.
>
> The Lighthouse score? 94.
>
> Automated tools are useful – but they can't see this.
>
> We've put some of our real findings into a short overview: [link in comments]

**Post 2 – List post (use `VisibleFocus.png`):**

> 3 things automated tools can't see that disabled users spot in 30 seconds:
>
> 1. Focus indicators that technically exist but are invisible on your colour scheme
> 2. Forms that "have labels" but announce nothing useful to a screen reader
> 3. Navigation that's "keyboard accessible" but requires 47 tabs to reach the main content
>
> Tools check the code. Users check the experience.
>
> We combine both at MyAccess.

**Post 3 – Impact post (use `MyAccess-001.png`):**

> When we pay disabled testers to walk through a site, we're not just finding issues.
>
> We're creating paid work for people who are often excluded from the job market.
>
> Every project funds our wider work supporting people living with sight loss across Oxfordshire.
>
> That's accessibility with purpose.

**Post 4 – Educational post (use `FormLabels.png`):**

> "Our forms are accessible – we added labels."
>
> We hear this a lot.
>
> Then we watch a screen reader user try to complete the form:
> - The label says "Name" but it's not programmatically linked
> - The screen reader announces "edit blank"
> - The user has no idea what information to enter
>
> Labels need to be *connected*, not just present.
>
> This is the kind of thing our disabled testers catch in minutes.

### Phase 2 – Webinar Promotion (Weeks 3–5)

Goal: Drive registrations.

**Post 5 – Webinar announcement (use `Webinar-001.png`):**

> In January, we're running a free session for agencies on what disabled users find that tools miss.
>
> **Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients**
> 📅 [Date]
> ⏰ [Time]
> 💻 Online, 60 minutes
>
> You'll see:
> - How 8–10 disabled users actually test a site
> - Where automated reports matched reality (and where they didn't)
> - A practical model for £5–15k projects
>
> Link to register in comments 👇

**Post 6 – Teaser snippet (use `TryTab.png`):**

> Here's something we found last month:
>
> A navigation menu that looked fine. Worked fine with a mouse.
>
> But when a keyboard user pressed Tab?
> - Focus jumped past the menu entirely
> - The only way to reach it was to Tab through 60+ elements
> - Most users gave up
>
> The automated scan? "All interactive elements are keyboard accessible." ✅
>
> We'll be walking through examples like this in our January webinar.
> [Registration link in comments]

**Post 7 – Why we pay testers (use `AltText-DarkBlue.png`):**

> A question we sometimes get:
>
> "Do your testers volunteer?"
>
> No. We pay every disabled tester for their time.
>
> Why?
> - Their expertise has value
> - Testing is real work
> - Too many "accessibility" initiatives rely on unpaid labour from disabled people
>
> Every MyAccess project creates paid work and funds our wider services.
>
> We'll talk more about this in our January webinar → [link]

**Post 8 – One week countdown (use `Webinar-002.png`):**

> One week until our session on accessibility testing for agencies.
>
> If you've ever wondered:
> - "Is our accessibility actually good enough?"
> - "How do we talk about this to clients?"
> - "What would disabled users actually experience on our sites?"
>
> This is for you.
>
> Free, 60 minutes, practical.
> [Register here]

**Post 9 – Day before (use `Webinar_003.png`):**

> Tomorrow at [time]:
>
> **Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients**
>
> We'll show what happens when real disabled users test websites that "passed" automated checks.
>
> Spoiler: it's often not what you'd expect.
>
> Last chance to register (or sign up for the recording): [link]

### Phase 3 – Post-webinar & Pilot (Weeks 5–7)

Goal: Turn interest into ongoing conversations.

**Post 10 – Recap post (use `HowItWorks.png`):**

> 3 things agencies took away from our disabled user testing webinar:
>
> 1. **Tools check code, users check experience.** Automated scans are useful – but they miss context, confusion, and workarounds.
>
> 2. **"We paid disabled users to test your site" wins tenders.** It's a more powerful story than a Lighthouse score.
>
> 3. **You don't need an internal accessibility team.** A repeatable service that plugs into your existing workflow is enough.
>
> Missed it? Watch the replay: [link]

**Post 11 – Pilot spotlight:**

> We're working with a small group of agencies to run one-site pilots.
>
> What's included:
> ✅ Scoping call to pick 1–2 key journeys
> ✅ 8–10 disabled testers using real assistive tech
> ✅ Combined automated + manual findings
> ✅ Agency portal access with stakeholder and developer views
> ✅ Prioritised remediation plan
> ✅ Live debrief with your team
>
> If you've been thinking "we should do something about accessibility" – this is a low-risk way to start.
>
> DM me or comment "interested" and I'll share details.

**Post 12 – Social proof / case angle:**

> After one pilot, an agency told us:
>
> "We used the report in our next tender. The client specifically mentioned it as a differentiator."
>
> That's the goal: make accessibility something you can *show*, not just claim.
>
> If you'd like to try this on one client site, we're running limited pilots now.
> Details: [link] or DM me.

## 3. Posting Cadence & Profiles

### Who should post?

- **Primary:** Mark’s personal profile (most reach & authenticity).
- **Secondary:** MyVision Oxfordshire organisational page.

### Cadence (guideline)

- Phase 1: 2 posts/week (Mark), 1 post/week (MyVision).  
- Phase 2: 2–3 posts/week (Mark), 1–2 posts/week (MyVision).  
- Phase 3: 1–2 posts/week total.

You can cross-post or rephrase between profiles; just avoid posting identical content at the exact same time.

---

## 4. LinkedIn Event for the Webinar

### Setup

- Create a **LinkedIn Event** with:
  - Title matching the webinar.
  - Date, time, time zone.
  - Short value-led description.
  - Link to your external registration page.

### Promotion

- Invite:
  - Existing 1st-degree connections who match your target roles.
  - People who engage with your accessibility posts.
- Share the Event in post copy (“we’ve created a LinkedIn Event for this session – details and registration link are there”).

---

## 5. Lead Sourcing & 1:1 Outreach

### Finding agencies and decision-makers

- Use LinkedIn search filters:
  - Company: “web design”, “digital agency”, “digital studio”, etc.
  - Location: United Kingdom.
  - Size: 2–10, 11–50, 51–200.
- On each profile:
  - Confirm they build bespoke sites.
  - Note any public sector/charity work (good fit).

### Outreach examples

1. **Pre-webinar DM (to warm leads):**  
   - “Hi {{name}}, I’m Mark from MyVision Oxfordshire. We’ve been helping agencies run disabled user testing on their sites. We’re doing a free January session on what disabled users find that tools miss – thought it might be relevant to your public sector work.”

2. **Post-webinar DM (to attendees):**  
   - “Thanks again for joining the session. If you’d ever like to try this on one client site, we’re running a limited number of one-site pilots – happy to share details.”

Keep messages short, human and optional – no hard push.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting & Things to Watch

### Metrics

- Post reactions and comments.
- Clicks on links (via UTM and site analytics).
- Event registrations from LinkedIn.
- Replies to DMs.

### Common issues

1. **Low engagement on posts**
   - Use more concrete stories, fewer abstract statements.
   - Ask simple questions (“Have you ever seen a site that ‘passed’ checks but still didn’t work for users?”).

2. **Event not gaining traction**
   - Repost at different times/days.
   - Directly invite a small, curated list of high-fit contacts.
   - Highlight what’s in it for them (not just what you’ll talk about).

3. **DMs ignored**
   - Shorten the message further.
   - Focus on value (“free session”) rather than description.
   - Don’t chase aggressively; LinkedIn is slow-burn.

---

## 7. Practical Tips

- Re-use your email content:
  - Turn bullet lists into LinkedIn lists/carousels.
  - Turn short stories into 1–2 paragraph posts.
- Always add **alt text** to images and describe key visuals.
- Stay away from “LinkedIn bro” tone; keep it plain, calm, and specific.
