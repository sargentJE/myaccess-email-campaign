# When Things Don't Work

Check this while the campaign is running. Don't wait until the end.

## What to track

**Email:**
- Opens, clicks, replies
- Unsubscribes, spam complaints

**Website:**
- Page views, time on page
- Registration conversions

**Webinar:**
- Registrations vs list size
- Live attendance vs registrations
- Replay views

**LinkedIn:**
- Impressions, reactions, comments
- Link clicks
- Event joins

**Commercial:**
- Discovery calls booked
- Pilots agreed

Review weekly. And after major sends (Email 1-3, 4-7, 8-9, webinar).

## Common problems

### Good opens, poor clicks

**Probably:**
- Subject line works but body copy isn't landing
- CTA buried or vague
- Next step doesn't feel valuable

**Try:**
- More specific CTA ("See 3 issues disabled users found" not "Learn more")
- Move CTA higher
- Add benefit line before the CTA

---

### Low opens across multiple emails

**Probably:**
- Subject lines too generic or long
- List is wrong people
- Deliverability issues

**Try:**
- A/B subject lines (curiosity vs benefit)
- Tighten targeting, remove non-fits
- Check SPF/DKIM/DMARC
- Simplify template

---

### Good engagement, poor webinar registrations

**Probably:**
- Value of webinar not clear
- Too much friction on reg page
- Timing doesn't work

**Try:**
- "What you'll get" at top of landing page
- Shorter form
- Add "register for recording" option
- Ask friendly agencies what would make them register

---

### High registration, low attendance

**Probably:**
- Weak reminders
- Timing (Friday afternoon)
- People planning to watch replay

**Try:**
- Better reminders (day before, 2 hours before)
- Emphasise live Q&A
- Make replay easy to access in follow-up

---

### Low interest in pilot

**Probably:**
- Offer not specific enough
- Pricing unclear
- Feels like a big jump from webinar

**Try:**
- Clearer bullet list of what's included
- Transparent about pricing range
- Share outcomes ("one agency used the report in a tender and...")

---

## When to pause

**Stop if:**
- Spam complaints spike
- Multiple "remove me" replies from a specific segment

**Keep going if:**
- Engagement is modest but steady
- Clicks but no conversions yet (B2B takes multiple touches)
- Only a few emails in

---

## After the campaign

Look at:
- Which emails got best clicks?
- Which LinkedIn posts got real engagement?
- Where did pilots actually come from?

Build an evergreen sequence from what worked:
- Emails 1-2 style awareness
- Webinar recording as the asset
- Pilot as ongoing offer

---

## Long-term nurture

**For "not now" replies:**
- Low-touch list
- Monthly email: one useful insight, no hard sell
- Quarterly check-in with soft CTA

**Triggers:**
- Site revisits
- New content published
- Seasonal moments ("Starting Q2 projects?")

**Win-back (3-6 months later):**
- "We've been working with agencies like yours – here's what we've learned"
- New case study
- Soft CTA
