# Troubleshooting & Optimisation – MyAccess Launch Campaign

This document helps you debug what’s happening **while the campaign is running**, and decide what to adjust.

---

## 1. Key Metrics at a Glance

Track at least:

- **Email:**
  - Opens, clicks, replies, unsubscribes, spam complaints.
- **Web:**
  - Page views, time on page, conversion rates (reg → webinar, webinar → pilot).
- **Webinar:**
  - Registrations, live attendance, replay views.
- **LinkedIn:**
  - Post impressions, reactions, comments, link clicks, event joins.
- **Commercial:**
  - Discovery calls booked.
  - Pilots agreed.

Review weekly during the campaign and after major sends (Email 1–3, 4–7, 8–9, webinar).

## 2. Common Scenarios & Responses

### Scenario A – Great open rates, poor click-through

**Likely causes:**

- Subject lines are strong, but the body copy isn’t landing.
- CTAs are buried or feel vague.
- The next step doesn’t feel valuable enough.

**What to try:**

- Make the CTA clearer and more concrete (“See 3 examples of issues disabled users found in live sites” rather than “learn more”).
- Move CTA higher (mid-email + end).
- Add a one-sentence benefit before the CTA: “If you only skim one thing…”

---

### Scenario B – Low opens across multiple emails

**Likely causes:**

- Subject lines aren’t resonating (too generic or too long).
- List is poorly targeted (wrong people / wrong agencies).
- Deliverability problems (hitting spam or Promotions tabs heavily).

**What to try:**

- A/B subject lines on a small segment:
  - Curiosity angle vs benefit angle.
- Verify list quality:
  - Remove obvious non-fits.
- Check technical setup:
  - SPF/DKIM/DMARC for your sending domain.
  - Reduce heavy images or complex templates.

---

### Scenario C – Good engagement, poor webinar registrations

**Likely causes:**

- The value of the webinar isn’t clear enough.
- Too much friction on the registration page.
- Timing/date doesn’t work for most people.

**What to try:**

- Tighten landing page copy:
  - Put “What you’ll walk away with” at the top.
  - Add 3–5 strong bullets.
- Shorten the form (only essential fields).
- Add “Can’t make it? Register to get the recording.”
- Ask friendly agencies for honest feedback on the invite and timing.

---

### Scenario D – Good registration, low attendance

**Likely causes:**

- Weak or missing reminder emails.
- Timing clashes (e.g. Friday late afternoon).
- People intend to watch the replay rather than attend live.

**What to try:**

- Ensure reminders:
  - 1 day before.
  - 1–2 hours before.
- Emphasise live-only benefits:
  - Q&A, chance to ask questions about their context.
- Make replay easy to access and clearly communicated in follow-up.

---

### Scenario E – Low interest in the pilot

**Likely causes:**

- Offer not specific enough.
- Agencies unclear on pricing or fit.
- Came across as “too big a jump” from a webinar.

**What to try:**

- Clarify what the pilot includes in bullet form:
  - One site, 1–2 journeys, 8–10 testers, fixed fee, clear timeline.
- Be transparent about pricing bands (even if not exact numbers).
- Share anonymised outcomes (“after the pilot, one agency used the findings to…”).

---

## 3. When to Pause, When to Push Through

### Pause if:

- Spam complaints spike.
- Multiple “please remove me” replies come from a specific sub-segment (e.g. agencies too small or too niche).

### Push through if:

- Engagement is modest but steady.
- People are clicking but just not converting yet.
- You’re mid-campaign and only a few emails in.

Remember: B2B campaigns often take multiple touches before someone acts.

---

## 4. Iterating After the Campaign

Once the initial launch window is over:

- Review:
  - Which emails had the best clicks?
  - Which LinkedIn posts got genuine engagement?
  - Where did pilots actually come from?
- Build a **short evergreen sequence** using the best-performing pieces:
  - Email 1–2 style awareness.
  - Webinar recording as an asset (instead of a live invite).
  - Pilot as an ongoing offer.

This turns your launch into a repeatable system rather than a one-off push.

---

## 5. Long-Term Nurture Strategy

For contacts who engaged but didn't convert during the campaign window:

### "Keep Me Updated" Segment

Anyone who replied with "not now" or similar:
- Add to a low-touch nurture list.
- Monthly email: 1 useful insight, tip, or mini case study.
- No hard sell – purely relationship maintenance.
- Quarterly "checking in" email with soft CTA.

### Re-engagement Triggers

Set up automated follow-ups when:
- A contact revisits the website (if tracking enabled).
- You publish new content (case study, blog post, webinar recording).
- Seasonal moments (start of Q2, pre-budget planning, etc.).

### Evergreen Sequence

After the live campaign:
1. Recycle Emails 1–3 with webinar recording CTA instead of live registration.
2. Use Email 8–9 structure for pilot offer.
3. Run this as an automated drip for new cold contacts.

### Win-Back Campaign (3–6 months later)

For contacts who went cold:
- "We've been working with agencies like yours – here's what we've learned."
- Share a new case study or anonymised outcome.
- Soft CTA: "If timing is better now, we'd love to chat."
