# Webinar Plan – “Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients”

## 1. Purpose of the Webinar

The webinar is the **centrepiece** of the launch:

- It turns abstract ideas from the emails into something concrete and visual.
- It gives agencies a low-risk way to “experience” MyAccess.
- It sets up the **one-site pilot** as the natural next step.

---

## 2. Format & Structure

### Duration

- **60 minutes total**:
  - ~35–40 minutes content.
  - ~20 minutes Q&A.

### Suggested agenda

1. **Welcome & context (5 mins)**
   - Who you are (Mark + MyVision).
   - Why you’re doing this (charity perspective + what you’re seeing in the field).

2. **The reality check (10 mins)**
   - One or two anonymised case examples of "compliant but unusable" journeys.
   - Short clips or annotated screenshots showing what disabled users actually experienced.
   - Emphasise multi-disability (visual, motor, cognitive).
   - **Suggested visuals:** `LooksVsReality.png`, `FormLabels.png`, `VisibleFocus.png`

3. **Automation vs disabled user testing (10 mins)**
   - What your automated scans showed.
   - What disabled users found.
   - Where they matched and where they didn't.
   - **Suggested visuals:** `TryTab.png`, `AltText-DarkBlue.png`

4. **How MyAccess works for agencies (10 mins)**
   - Simple, non-technical walkthrough of:
     - Scoping.
     - Testing.
     - Portal & report.
     - Debrief.
   - **Live portal demo:** Walk through the agency portal showing:
     - Multi-site dashboard view
     - Switching between stakeholder and developer report views
     - Filtering issues by severity/component/journey
     - Exporting findings for Jira/Trello
   - Show how outputs map to agency workflows.
   - **Suggested visual:** `HowItWorks.png`

5. **One-site pilot offer (5 mins)**
   - For agencies who want to try this on one client site.
   - Outline inclusions, timeline, and who it’s for.

6. **Q&A (15–20 mins)**
   - Answer practical questions.
   - Focus on fit, workflow, pricing philosophy (not bespoke quotes).

## 2.5 Concrete Examples to Prepare

Before the webinar, prepare these specific examples to make the content tangible:

### Example 1: The Donation Form
- **Automated result:** "All form fields have associated labels" ✅
- **User experience:** Screen reader announced "edit blank" for every field
- **Root cause:** Labels present in HTML but not programmatically linked
- **Visual:** Annotated screenshot or short video clip
- **Use:** `FormLabels.png` as supporting visual

### Example 2: The Navigation Menu
- **Automated result:** "All interactive elements are keyboard accessible" ✅
- **User experience:** Focus skipped the menu entirely; required 60+ tabs to reach
- **Root cause:** Focus order not matching visual order
- **Visual:** Recording of keyboard user attempting navigation
- **Use:** `TryTab.png` as supporting visual

### Example 3: The Checkout/Action Button
- **Automated result:** "Button has accessible name" ✅
- **User experience:** Screen reader just said "button" with no context
- **Root cause:** Generic button text, no descriptive label
- **Visual:** Side-by-side of what sighted vs screen reader users experience

### Example 4: Missing Alt Text Context
- **Automated result:** "Image has alt text" ✅
- **User experience:** Alt text said "image1.jpg" or was overly generic
- **Root cause:** Alt text present but not meaningful
- **Visual:** `AltText-DarkBlue.png` or `AltText-LightBlue.png`

## 3. Promotion & Registration

### Promotion

- Email 4–7 in your sequence.
- LinkedIn:
  - Event page.
  - Regular posts with concrete hooks (“We’ll show where tools missed things that users found immediately.”).

### Registration

- Use your **webinar registration page** with a short form.
- Offer the **recording** to people who cannot attend live.
- Send automated confirmations + reminders:
  - Immediately upon registration.
  - 1 day before.
  - 1–2 hours before.

---

## 4. Running the Webinar

### Accessibility

- Provide live captions if possible.
- Describe key visuals verbally as you go.
- Share slides afterwards in an accessible format (e.g. tagged PDF).

### Engagement

- Use simple polls (e.g. “Do you currently use automated tools?”, “Have your clients ever asked for accessibility reporting?”).
- Encourage questions throughout and answer in the Q&A.

### Recording

- Record the session.
- Trim the start/end if needed and host the replay on your site or a private link.
- Use this for:
  - Email 8 (replay + pilot offer).
  - LinkedIn recap posts.
  - Ongoing evergreen nurturing.

---

## 5. Post-Webinar Follow-Up

### Within 24 hours

- Send Email 8:
  - Thank attendees.
  - Link to replay.
  - Present the one-site pilot in clear bullet points.
  - CTA: book a discovery call.

### 3–5 days later

- Send Email 9:
  - Final reminder about the pilot.
  - Mention limited slots/timeframe.

### Segment-based outreach

- **High-intent attendees** (asked questions, stayed to the end):
  - Consider a personalised email or LinkedIn DM referencing their specific interest.
- **Registrants who didn’t attend**:
  - Emphasise replay link and reassure that the pilot is still available.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting & Things to Watch

### Metrics

- Registration count (vs list size).
- Attendance rate (live vs registrants).
- Replay views (first 1–2 weeks).
- Number of discovery calls/pilots requested.

### Common issues

1. **High registration, low attendance**
   - Improve reminder emails.
   - Emphasise replay availability.
   - Check timing/day of week.

2. **Low registration**
   - Rework email subject lines and LinkedIn hooks to be more benefit-led.
   - Clarify outcomes in landing page copy (“you’ll walk away with…”).
   - Ask a few friendly agencies directly what would make it irresistible.

3. **Flat Q&A**
   - Prepare 3–4 “seed questions” to answer if the audience is shy.
   - Invite questions ahead of time via email and LinkedIn.

---

## 7. Practical Tips

- Practice the run-through once with someone acting as “host/moderator”.
- Keep slides visually simple, high-contrast, and text-light.
- Make the pilot CTA clear but not pushy: “If this resonates, here’s an easy way to try it on one site.”
