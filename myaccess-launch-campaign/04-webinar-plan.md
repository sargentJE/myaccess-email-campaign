# Webinar Plan

The webinar is the main conversion point. It turns abstract stuff from the emails into something people can actually see.

---

## Format

60 minutes total:
- 35-40 mins content
- 20 mins Q&A

---

## Agenda

**1. Welcome (5 mins)**
Who we are. Why we're doing this. Charity context.

**2. The reality check (10 mins)**
One or two anonymised examples of "compliant but unusable" journeys. Clips or annotated screenshots of what disabled users actually experienced.

Use: `LooksVsReality.png`, `FormLabels.png`, `VisibleFocus.png`

**3. Automation vs disabled users (10 mins)**
What the scan said. What users found. Where they matched and where they didn't.

Use: `TryTab.png`, `AltText-DarkBlue.png`

**4. How MyAccess works (10 mins)**
Walk through the process: scoping, testing, portal, report, debrief.

Live portal demo:
- Multi-site view
- Switch between stakeholder and developer views
- Filter by severity/component
- Export to Jira

Use: `HowItWorks.png`

**5. The pilot (5 mins)**
What's included. Who it's for. Timeline.

**6. Q&A (15-20 mins)**
Answer questions. Focus on fit, workflow, pricing approach (not specific quotes).

## Examples to prepare

Have these ready with screenshots or clips:

**Donation form**
- Automated: "All fields have labels" ✅
- User experience: Screen reader said "edit blank" for every field
- Root cause: Labels present but not connected
- Visual: `FormLabels.png`

**Navigation menu**
- Automated: "All elements keyboard accessible" ✅
- User experience: Focus jumped past the menu, needed 60+ tabs
- Root cause: Focus order wrong
- Visual: `TryTab.png`

**Checkout button**
- Automated: "Button has accessible name" ✅
- User experience: Just said "button" with no context
- Root cause: Generic text, no descriptive label

**Alt text**
- Automated: "Image has alt text" ✅
- User experience: Alt text was "image1.jpg" or too generic
- Visual: `AltText-DarkBlue.png`
