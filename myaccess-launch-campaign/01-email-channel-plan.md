# Email Plan

Email is the spine of the campaign. It's doing the heavy lifting on awareness, webinar registrations, and pilot conversion.

## The sequence

### Phase 1: Awareness (Dec 1-15)

**Email 1** – The donation form story
Opens with the blind user who couldn't donate on a site with a 94 Lighthouse score. Sets up the core problem. CTA: look at MyAccess overview.

**Email 2** – Automation vs real users
What's the difference between "passes checks" and "actually works"? Introduces the two-layer report concept. CTA: view sample report.

**Email 3** – Who the testers are
Humanises the service. Real disabled people, paid for their time. First soft mention of the webinar. CTA: register interest.

### Phase 2: Webinar (Dec 18 – mid-Jan)

**Email 4** – Main invite
Full details: date, time, what you'll learn. CTA: register.

**Email 5** – Post-holiday reminder
Early January. "New year, same question from clients." CTA: register.

**Email 6** – What you'll walk away with
One week out. Be specific about takeaways. CTA: register.

**Email 7** – Last chance
Day before. Short, punchy. CTA: register (or get recording).

### Phase 3: Conversion (after webinar)

**Email 8** – Thanks + pilot details
Full breakdown of what the pilot includes. CTA: book a call.

**Email 9** – Final nudge
Scarcity angle (limited slots). CTA: book or reply "keep me posted".

## Who we're emailing

UK web/digital agencies, roughly 2-100 people.

We want decision makers: founders, MDs, heads of UX/design, tech leads, senior PMs.

Most of these are cold contacts.

---

## Finding them

**LinkedIn:** Company search with filters (UK, agency, size). Look at individual profiles.

**Directories:** Clutch, BIMA, The Drum, DesignRush. Manual research.

**Our network:** Anyone MyVision already knows.

---

## List hygiene

- Stick to corporate emails (name@agency.co.uk)
- Always include unsubscribe
- Maintain a suppression list
- Store only what you need

---

## What to watch

**Open rate:** Under 25% for emails 1-3? Subject lines or list quality problem.

**Click rate:** Aiming for 3-5% clicking through to overview/report/webinar.

**Replies:** Even "not interested" replies are a signal. Better than silence.

---

## When things go wrong

**Low opens:**
- Test different subject lines
- Check deliverability (SPF/DKIM)
- Simplify the template

**Opens but no clicks:**
- CTA is buried or vague
- Move it higher
- Make it more specific

**Clicks but no registrations:**
- Landing page isn't working
- Form too long
- Value proposition unclear
