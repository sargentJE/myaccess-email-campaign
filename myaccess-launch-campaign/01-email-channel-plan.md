# Email Marketing Plan – MyAccess Launch

## 1. Purpose of the Email Channel

Email is the **spine of the campaign**. It:

- Introduces MyAccess and the problem it solves.
- Nurtures cold agencies from “never heard of you” to “this is worth our attention”.
- Drives **webinar registrations**.
- Follows up with **pilot offers** after the webinar.

The sequence is designed so each email has **one big idea** and **one primary CTA**.

## 2. Sequence Overview (9 Emails)

### Email 1 – Awareness: The gap between "accessible" and usable

- **Goal:** Awareness and curiosity.
- **Core message:** Sites that "meet the guidelines" still fail disabled people on basic journeys.
- **Key points:**
  - Multi-disability framing (visual, motor, cognitive, etc.).
  - Simple examples of failures in real tasks (donate, book, checkout).
  - MyAccess introduced lightly as a response, not a hard sell.
- **CTA:** View MyAccess overview + example findings.
- **Image:** `LooksVsReality.png` – illustrates the gap between compliance and usability.

### Email 2 – Automation vs disabled user testing

- **Goal:** Show MyAccess as a complement to existing tools, not a replacement.
- **Core message:** You already use Lighthouse/axe/WAVE; disabled user testing completes the picture.
- **Key points:**
  - Tools are good for scale and quick checks.
  - Disabled testers provide context, nuance, and credibility.
  - One combined picture (automation + users), not two conflicting reports.
  - Agency portal gives one place to view all findings across sites.
- **CTA:** View a sample report or findings snapshot.
- **Image:** `HowItWorks.png` – shows the MyAccess process.

### Email 3 – Meet the testers & social impact (first webinar mention)

- **Goal:** Humanise the work and gently introduce the webinar.
- **Core message:** Real disabled testers, paid work, and charity impact.
- **Key points:**
  - Who the testers are, what tech they use.
  - How agencies reuse the social impact story in tenders.
  - Tease the upcoming webinar: "we'll show this in action in January."
- **CTA:** Register interest / "be first to hear about the webinar".
- **Image:** `MyAccess-001.png` – brand/identity image.

### Email 4 – Main webinar invite

### Email 5 – Post-holiday reminder

  - "The accessibility gap your Lighthouse score won't show"

### Email 6 – "What you'll walk away with"

- **CTA:** Register (even for recording).
- **Image:** Optional – can go text-only for urgency, or reuse `Webinar-001.png`.

### Email 8 – Post-webinar thanks + pilot offer

- **Goal:** Convert interest into conversations.
- **Core message:** "Here's the pilot we mentioned – a safe way to test this on one client site."
- **Key points:**
  - What's included in the pilot (scoping call, 8–10 testers, portal access, report, debrief).
  - Emphasis on pricing sized for £5–15k builds.
  - Highlight the agency portal: "See all your findings in one dashboard."

## 3. Sourcing & Managing the Email List

### Who to Include

- UK-based web/digital agencies:
  - Size: roughly 2–100 people.
  - Focus on custom sites (not just template resellers).
- Decision-makers:
  - Founder / MD
  - Head of UX / Design
  - Technical / Engineering lead
  - Senior PM / Delivery lead

### How to Find Them

- LinkedIn:
  - Use company search + filters (location: UK, industry: marketing/design/IT).
  - Identify key roles on each company profile.
- Agency directories:
  - Clutch, BIMA, The Drum, DesignRush, “top web agencies UK” lists.
  - Manually collect agency name, website, sectors, and best contact.
- MyVision network:
  - Agencies you already know (e.g. local partners, previous collaborators).

### Data hygiene & compliance (UK context)

- Prioritise **corporate email addresses** (e.g. name@agency.co.uk).
- Always include:
  - Clear unsubscribe / “opt out” link or instructions.
  - A suppression list in your email platform to ensure you never contact opt-outs again.
- Store only what you need:
  - Name, email, role, agency, rough fit notes (e.g. “has charity clients”).

## 4. Troubleshooting & Things to Watch

### Metrics to monitor

- **Open rate:** If < 25–30% for Email 1–3, your list or subject lines may be off.
- **Click-through rate (CTR):** You want at least 3–5% clicking through to the overview/report/webinar.
- **Reply rate:** Some may reply with questions or mild pushback; that’s a good sign.

### Common problems & fixes

1. **Low opens**
   - Test alternative subject lines (more curiosity, more concrete benefit).
   - Check deliverability: avoid heavy HTML, test from-address reputation.

2. **Cold responses (“not relevant”)**
   - Tighten targeting (remove agencies that don’t fit your ICP).
   - Segment by niche (e.g. “agencies with public/charity clients”) and adjust wording accordingly.

3. **Good opens, poor webinar registrations**
   - Check the clarity and prominence of the webinar CTA.
   - Make sure registration form is short and mobile-friendly.
   - Add “register for the recording” language.

4. **Spam / unsubscribes**
   - If spam reports creep up, slow cadence or reduce volume.
   - Keep language respectful, non-pushy, and clearly value-led.

## 5. Practical Tips

- Build the sequence into your email platform as an **automation**, so new contacts can be added and run through it in order.
- Use **UTM parameters** on all links to track which email drove which action (e.g. `utm_source=email&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=myaccess_webinar&utm_content=email2`).
- Re-use email content for other channels (e.g. LinkedIn posts, slide snippets) to maximise your effort.
