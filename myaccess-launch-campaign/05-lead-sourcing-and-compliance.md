# Finding Leads

The emails are solid. But they only work if the right people receive them.

Prioritise quality over volume. Better to have 200 good-fit contacts than 1,000 random ones.

## Who we're looking for

**Agencies:**
- UK based
- Web/digital (design, dev, UX)

**Good signs:**

## Where to find them

**LinkedIn (main source)**

- Clutch – filter UK, web design/dev
- BIMA – UK agency membership body
- The Drum – rankings and directories

## Cold email (be careful)

Cold email to scraped addresses is legally grey in the UK and often doesn't work.

If you do it:
- Corporate addresses only (not personal Gmail)
- Research each contact – no spray and pray
- Personalised – reference their work
- Small batches – 10-20 per week
- Clear opt-out
- Expect 1-5% response

Don't:
- Scrape thousands and blast them
- Use personal email addresses
- Hide who you are
- Make unsubscribing hard
- Keep emailing people who don't engage

---

## Compliance basics

**GDPR/PECR:**
- Corporate addresses have more flexibility than personal
- Email must be relevant to their professional role
- Soft opt-in applies if there's existing relationship
- Cold contact needs legitimate interest + easy opt-out
- Always include unsubscribe

**Best practice:**
- Prioritise opted-in (webinar, content downloads)
- Use LinkedIn for cold outreach first (less regulated)
- Keep cold email small and personalised
- Maintain suppression list
- Be transparent

## What to expect

| Source | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Webinar follow-up | 10-20% open, 3-5% click |
| Opted-in nurture | 25-40% open, 5-10% click |
| LinkedIn connection | 20-40% acceptance |
| LinkedIn InMail | 10-25% response |
| Cold email (targeted) | 15-25% open, 1-3% reply |
| Cold email (scraped) | 5-15% open, <1% reply |

**Red flags:**
- Open rate under 15% → list or subject line problem
- Bounce rate over 5% → stale data
- Spam complaints → stop and rethink
- Unsubscribe over 2% per send → wrong audience or too frequent
