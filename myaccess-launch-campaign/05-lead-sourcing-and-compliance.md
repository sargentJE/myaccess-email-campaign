# Lead Sourcing & Compliance Plan

This document covers how to build your audience for the MyAccess launch campaign. The approach prioritises **compliance, quality, and conversion** over raw list size.

> **Key principle:** The email sequence is excellent – but it only works if recipients have some reason to open it. Prioritise opted-in leads and warm outreach over cold scraped lists.

## 1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Agencies

- **Location:** United Kingdom.
- **Type:** Web/digital agencies (design, development, UX).
- **Size:** Roughly 2–100 staff.
- **Work:** Bespoke websites or applications (not just theme resales).
- **Sweet spot:** Agencies with charity, university, council, or NHS clients (accessibility often required in tenders).

### Decision-Makers

- Founders / Managing Directors.
- Heads of UX / Design.
- Technical / Engineering Leads.
- Senior Project / Delivery Managers.

### Signals of High Fit

- Mention accessibility on their website (even if basic).
- Public sector / charity clients in their portfolio.
- Team of 5–50 (big enough to have process, small enough to not have internal specialists).
- Active on LinkedIn discussing web/UX topics.

## 3. LinkedIn Ads (Recommended Primary Channel)

LinkedIn Ads let you reach your exact ICP with full compliance.

### Targeting Options

### Ad Formats to Use

1. **Lead Gen Forms** (Highest priority)
   - Promote the webinar
   - User fills form without leaving LinkedIn
   - Pre-filled from profile = high completion rate
   - Typical cost: £5–15 per lead

2. **Sponsored Content**
   - Promote your best-performing organic posts
   - Drive to webinar registration page
   - Good for awareness before lead capture

3. **Document Ads**
   - Upload sample report as downloadable
   - Capture email in exchange
   - Great for mid-funnel

4. **Event Ads**
   - If using LinkedIn Events for webinar
   - Native promotion with RSVP tracking

### Budget Guidance

- **Minimum test:** £500–1,000 over 2–3 weeks
- **Recommended for launch:** £1,500–3,000 across the 6-week campaign
- **Expected results:** 100–300 webinar registrations at £5–15 each

### Key Metrics

- CTR (Click-through rate): Aim for >0.5%
- Lead form completion: Aim for >10%
- Cost per lead: £5–15 is good for this niche
- Cost per webinar attendee: £15–40 (accounting for no-shows)

## 4. LinkedIn Organic Strategy

Free but requires consistent effort.

### LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Recommended)

- **Cost:** ~£60–80/month
- **Benefits:**
  - Advanced search filters
  - Save lead lists
  - See who's viewed your profile
  - InMail credits for direct outreach
  - Track engagement with your content

### Connection Strategy

1. **Find targets:** Use Sales Navigator or standard search
2. **Check fit:** Review their profile, company, recent posts
3. **Personalised connection request:**
   - Reference something specific (their work, a post, mutual connection)
   - Do NOT pitch in the connection request
   - Example: "Hi Sarah, I noticed [Agency] has done some great work for [charity client]. I work on accessibility testing for agencies – would love to connect."

4. **Nurture before asking:**
   - Engage with their content for 1–2 weeks
   - Share valuable insights (not pitches)
   - Then introduce the webinar naturally

### Content Engagement

- Comment thoughtfully on posts from target accounts
- Share their work (if genuinely good)
- Be visible before you ask for anything

---

## 5. Compliant Email List Building

### Opted-In Sources (Use These)

1. **Webinar registrations**
   - Primary source of compliant email contacts
   - Clear opt-in with expectation of follow-up
   - The email sequence (4–9) is designed for these contacts

2. **Content downloads**
   - Gated sample report or accessibility checklist
   - Form captures email with clear consent
   - Follow up with relevant nurture sequence

3. **Website enquiries**
   - Contact form submissions
   - Demo/call requests
   - Explicit interest = permission to email

4. **Event contacts**
   - Business cards from conferences/meetups
   - First email should reference how you met
   - Implied consent from professional context

5. **Existing network**
   - Past collaborators
   - Agencies MyVision has worked with
   - Warm contacts who know you

### Cold Email (Use with Caution)

Cold email to scraped addresses is legally grey in the UK and often ineffective.

**If you do cold email:**

- **Only corporate addresses** (name@agency.co.uk, not personal Gmail)
- **Research each contact** – don't spray and pray
- **Highly personalised** – reference their work, clients, or something specific
- **Small batches** – 10–20 per week, not hundreds
- **Clear opt-out** – make it easy to unsubscribe
- **Expect low response** – 1–5% is typical for cold B2B

**Tools like Hunter, Apollo, Snov:**

- Can find email addresses from company domains
- Data quality varies (often stale)
- Use for enrichment of known targets, not mass scraping
- Don't use for bulk cold campaigns

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Scrape thousands of emails and blast them
- ❌ Use personal email addresses without consent
- ❌ Hide your identity or purpose
- ❌ Make unsubscribing difficult
- ❌ Continue emailing people who don't engage

---

## 6. Referral & Partner Channel

Often overlooked but highest conversion rate.

### Referral Requests

Ask existing contacts:
- "Do you know any agency owners who've mentioned accessibility challenges?"
- "Which agencies in your network work with charities/councils?"
- Offer to make it easy: "I can send you a short intro you can forward."

### Potential Partners

- WordPress hosting companies (WP Engine, Kinsta)
- Design tool companies (Figma, Sketch communities)
- Dev tool companies (GitHub, GitLab)
- Agency networks (BIMA, DBA)
- Accessibility consultants (for referrals they can't serve)

### Co-Marketing Opportunities

- Guest post on partner blog
- Joint webinar
- Mentioned in partner newsletter
- Shared on partner social channels

---

## 7. Agency Directories (For Research, Not Scraping)

Use directories to **identify** target agencies, not to scrape emails.

### Useful Directories

- **Clutch** – filter by UK, web design/development, reviews
- **BIMA** – UK digital agency membership body
- **The Drum** – agency rankings and directories
- **DesignRush** – agency listings with portfolio links
- **Awwwards** – high-end agencies (may be too large)

### How to Use

1. Create a target list of agency names
2. Research each on LinkedIn
3. Find decision-makers
4. Connect on LinkedIn (don't email cold)
5. Nurture into webinar registration

---

## 8. Compliance Considerations (UK Context)

### GDPR / PECR Summary

- **Corporate subscribers** (Ltd/LLP/PLC work addresses) have slightly more flexibility than individuals
- **But** – the email must be relevant to their professional role
- **Soft opt-in** applies if there's an existing relationship
- **Cold contact** is riskier – requires legitimate interest and easy opt-out
- **Always** include unsubscribe option and honour it

### Best Practice

- Prioritise opted-in contacts (webinar, content downloads)
- For cold outreach, use LinkedIn first (less regulated than email)
- Keep cold email small-scale and personalised
- Maintain a suppression list religiously
- Be transparent about who you are and why you're contacting them

### If in Doubt

Seek legal advice specific to your situation. This document is guidance, not legal counsel.

## 9. Metrics & Expectations

### Realistic Benchmarks

| Source | Expected Response Rate |
|--------|------------------------|
| Webinar follow-up (Email 8–9) | 10–20% open, 3–5% click |
| Opted-in nurture sequence | 25–40% open, 5–10% click |
| LinkedIn connection acceptance | 20–40% |
| LinkedIn InMail response | 10–25% |
| Cold email (well-targeted) | 15–25% open, 1–3% reply |
| Cold email (scraped list) | 5–15% open, <1% reply |

### Warning Signs

- Open rate <15% → List quality or subject line issue
- Bounce rate >5% → Stale/bad data
- Spam complaints → Stop and reassess approach
- Unsubscribe rate >2% per send → Targeting or frequency issue
