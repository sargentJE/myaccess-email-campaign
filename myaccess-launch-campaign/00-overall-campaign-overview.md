# MyAccess Launch Campaign – Overall Plan

This folder contains a practical launch plan for the **MyVision MyAccess disabled user testing service**, covering:

- Email marketing
- LinkedIn
- Website & landing pages
- Webinar
- Lead sourcing & data hygiene
- Troubleshooting & optimisation

The campaign is designed for a **6–7 week window** (early December to mid–January) and assumes:

- Target: **small–mid UK web/digital agencies** building sites in the **£5–15k** range.
- Targets are mostly **cold** (no prior engagement with MyVision/MyAccess).
- The campaign centres on a **January webinar**, with email + LinkedIn as the main promotion and a **one-site pilot** as the main commercial next step.

## 1. Campaign Phases

### Phase 1 – Awareness & Education (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Put MyAccess on the radar and define the problem (compliant but unusable sites).

- Email 1: The gap between “accessible” and actually usable (multi-disability angle).
- Email 2: Automation vs disabled user testing (how they fit together).
- Email 3: "Meet the testers" + first soft mention of the webinar.
- LinkedIn: 2 posts/week echoing the same themes (use `LooksVsReality.png`, `FormLabels.png`, `VisibleFocus.png`).
- Website: MyAccess overview page live, including agency portal preview.

### Phase 2 – Webinar Promotion (Weeks 3–5)

**Goal:** Drive registrations for the January webinar.

- Email 4: Main webinar invite (title, date, time, agenda).
- Email 5: “Back from break” reminder (early January).
- Email 6: “What you’ll walk away with” one week before.
- Email 7: Last-chance reminder 1–2 days before.
- LinkedIn:
  - Create LinkedIn Event for the webinar.
  - 2–3 posts/week plugging the event with value-led hooks (use `Webinar-001.png`, `Webinar-002.png`, `Webinar_003.png`).
- Website: Webinar registration page.

### Phase 3 – Post-Webinar & Pilot Conversion (Weeks 5–7)

**Goal:** Turn engagement into discovery calls and **one-site pilots**.

- Email 8: Post-webinar thanks + replay + pilot offer.
- Email 9: Final “for now” nudge to book a call.
- LinkedIn:
  - Post-webinar recap post with key lessons and replay link.
  - 1:1 outreach to high-intent attendees.

## 2. Core Narrative

Across all channels, the campaign tells a coherent story:

1. **Problem:** Many sites that "meet the guidelines" still fail disabled people on basic journeys.
2. **Reality:** Automated tools are useful but limited – they can't see lived experience.
3. **Solution:** MyAccess combines automated scans with **paid disabled testers** (multi-disability, multi-AT) and agency-ready reporting via a dedicated **agency portal**.
4. **Impact:** Agencies get better tenders, less guesswork, and a credible social impact story.
5. **Next Step:** The January webinar → one-site pilot → long-term partnership.

### Key Assets

- **Agency Portal:** Centralised dashboard where agencies view reports for all their sites, switch between stakeholder/developer views, filter issues, and track remediation progress.
- **Sample Reports:** Multiple real examples available to share with prospects.
- **Image Assets:** Full set of campaign graphics in `CampaignAssets/Images/` for emails, LinkedIn, and webinar slides.

Each asset in this folder dives into one channel and shows how to execute and debug it in practice.
