## The structure

**Weeks 1-2: Awareness**
Get on their radar. Define the problem (sites that pass checks but fail users).

- Email 1-3: Story-led, educational, no hard sell
- LinkedIn: 2 posts per week (same themes, different format)
- Website: Landing page live at myvision.org.uk/disabled-user-testing/

**Weeks 3-5: Webinar push**
Drive registrations.

- Email 4-7: Webinar invites and reminders
- LinkedIn: Event created, 2-3 posts per week
- Create LinkedIn Event for webinar

**Weeks 5-7: Convert**
Turn interest into pilots.

- Email 8-10: Post-webinar follow-up with pilot details
- LinkedIn: Recap post, 1:1 outreach to engaged attendees
- Monthly nurture for non-converters

## The story we're telling

Same thread across all channels:

1. **Problem:** Sites that "meet guidelines" still lock out disabled users
2. **Why:** Automated tools miss over 70% of real-world barriers
3. **Solution:** MyWeb Access combines automation with 10+ paid disabled testers
4. **Benefit:** Better tenders, less guesswork, credible social impact
5. **Next step:** Webinar → pilot → ongoing partnership

**Key stats from the site:**
- £274 billion Purple Pound (UK spending power of disabled people and families)
- 71% of disabled customers leave a website immediately if they encounter difficulties
- Automated scans miss over 70% of real-world barriers
