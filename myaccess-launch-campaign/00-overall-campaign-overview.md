# Campaign Overview

This is the launch plan for MyAccess – our disabled user testing service for agencies.

**Timeline:** 6 weeks, early December to mid-January
**Target:** UK web agencies, £5-15k project range
**Goal:** Get people to a January webinar, then convert to one-site pilots

---

## The structure

**Weeks 1-2: Awareness**
Get on their radar. Define the problem (sites that pass checks but fail users).

- Email 1-3: Story-led, educational, no hard sell
- LinkedIn: 2 posts per week (same themes, different format)
- Website: MyAccess overview page goes live

**Weeks 3-5: Webinar push**
Drive registrations.

- Email 4-7: Webinar invites and reminders
- LinkedIn: Event created, 2-3 posts per week
- Create LinkedIn Event for webinar

**Weeks 5-7: Convert**
Turn interest into pilots.

- Email 8-9: Post-webinar follow-up with pilot details
- LinkedIn: Recap post, 1:1 outreach to engaged attendees

## The story we're telling

Same thread across all channels:

1. **Problem:** Sites that "meet guidelines" still lock out disabled users
2. **Why:** Automated tools can't see lived experience
3. **Solution:** MyAccess combines automation with paid disabled testers
4. **Benefit:** Better tenders, less guesswork, credible social impact
5. **Next step:** Webinar → one-site pilot → ongoing partnership

## Key assets

**Agency portal:** Dashboard where agencies see all their sites, switch between stakeholder/developer views, filter issues, export to Jira.

**Sample reports:** Real examples to share with prospects.

**Images:** Full set in `CampaignAssets/Images/`
