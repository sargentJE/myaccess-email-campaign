Subject: Automated tools vs real disabled users: what’s the difference?
Preheader: Your clients believe lived experience more than a score out of 100.

Hi {{first_name}},

Most agencies we speak to are already running tools like Lighthouse, axe or WAVE. That’s a good start.

The difficulty is what you can *honestly* say to a client afterwards.

“We’ve run some checks and fixed what we can” is fine.  
But it’s very different from being able to say:

> “We paid 8–10 disabled users to complete key journeys on your site.  
> Here’s what happened, and here’s what we’ve fixed as a result.”

For a university, council or charity client, that's a much more powerful sentence in a pitch, a board meeting, or a steering group.

Here's a real example: last month, a site we tested had a Lighthouse accessibility score of 94. When our blind tester tried to complete the donation form, her screen reader just said "edit blank" – over and over. The labels were there in the HTML. They just weren't connected to anything.

Automated tools saw labels. Our tester saw a dead end.

### How MyAccess fits alongside your existing tools

**MyAccess** isn’t about throwing out automation. We use it under the hood.

What we do is:

- Run baseline automated scans on key templates  
- Put 8–10 disabled users (screen reader, magnifier, low-vision, keyboard-only, etc.) through 1–2 critical journeys  
- Join everything up in a way that works for agencies, not just compliance specialists

The agency gets:

- A **business/stakeholder view** – impact, risk, user quotes, top priorities  
- A **developer view** – issues grouped by template/component, with suggested fixes  
- A **prioritised remediation plan** – what to tackle now, next, and later
- **Portal access** – one dashboard to view findings across all your sites, filter by severity or component, and export straight to Jira or Trello

And crucially: every tester is **paid for their time**, and every project helps fund MyVision’s frontline work with people living with sight loss.

### “Our clients won’t pay for this”

We hear that a lot.

In practice, agencies are:

- Passing MyAccess through as a clearly-defined line item on larger projects, or  
- Offering it as an upsell to clients where accessibility and inclusion really matter

Because the pricing is designed for £5–15k builds, it’s usually a small fraction of the overall budget – and often ends up as a profit-neutral or even profit-positive service line once you’ve factored it into your proposals.

If you’d like to see exactly what an agency gets from a typical engagement:

Or just hit reply with **“quick chat?”** and we’ll find 15 minutes to talk about how this could fit your current way of working.

Best,
