Subject: Tomorrow at 10am
Preheader: Last chance to register (or get the recording)

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick one – our accessibility session is tomorrow.

**Friday, 30th January at 10am**

We'll show what happens when real disabled users test sites that "passed" automated checks.

Spoiler: it's often not what you'd expect.

Can't join live? Register anyway and we'll send you the recording.
