Subject: Tomorrow: live session on disabled user testing for agencies
Preheader: A practical, no-jargon session on accessibility with real disabled users.

Hi {{first_name}},

A quick reminder that our **Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients** webinar is happening on:

**{{webinar_date}} at {{webinar_time}}**

If you work on web projects in the £5–15k range and want a realistic way to:

- Involve real disabled users  
- Make accessibility easier to sell to clients  
- Turn findings into clear tickets rather than vague "to-dos"

…this session is for you.

Spoiler: what disabled users find is often not what you'd expect.

👉 **[Register for the webinar]({{webinar_link}})**

If you can’t join live, feel free to register anyway – we’ll send the recording, along with details of the **one-site pilot** we’re offering to a small group of agencies afterwards.

Hope to see you there,  
**Mark**
