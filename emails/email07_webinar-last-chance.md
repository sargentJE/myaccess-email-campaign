Subject: Tomorrow – what disabled users actually find
Preheader: Last chance to register (or get the recording)

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick one – our accessibility session is tomorrow.

**Friday, 30th January at 10am**

We'll show what happens when real disabled users test sites that "passed" automated checks.

Spoiler: it's often not what you'd expect.

If you work on £5-15k web projects and want a practical way to make accessibility real (without building an internal team), this will be useful.

Can't join live? Register anyway and we'll send you the recording, plus details of the pilot we're offering to a small group of agencies.

See you there,
Mark
