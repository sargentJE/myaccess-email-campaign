Subject: How one agency used this in a tender
Preheader: A quick story from a recent pilot

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick story from an agency we worked with recently.

They were pitching for a community organisation's website rebuild. The brief mentioned accessibility but didn't require anything specific.

They included our disabled user testing as part of their proposal – scoped as a line item, run after the build phase.

The client told them afterwards it was one of the reasons they won. Not just because it was "good practice" but because no other agency had offered anything like it.

The actual quote: "We've never had anyone offer to pay real disabled users to test our site."

---

What made the difference wasn't just the testing. It was what we found.

Their forms had a 0% completion rate for screen reader users. Every field announced as "edit blank" – no indication of what information to enter. One of our testers said:

> "I couldn't tell which fields were which. I eventually gave up trying to reach them online."

The automated scan? All green. "All fields have labels."

When the agency showed the client the gap between the scan and the real user experience, they got it immediately. And they had something concrete to put in future tenders.

---

If you're working on any proposals where accessibility might come up – councils, universities, charities, NHS trusts – this could be worth a conversation.

No pitch. Just a look at whether this makes sense for a current project.
