Subject: The people behind the testing
Preheader: Real disabled users, paid for their time.

Hi {{first_name}},

I've been talking about what we find. I wanted to say a bit about who finds it.

When we test a site, we work with real disabled people who use assistive technology every day:

- Screen reader users (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard-only users (including people with motor impairments)
- People who rely on magnification or high contrast
- People with cognitive differences (dyslexia, ADHD, autism)

For each project, 8-10 of them try to complete the journeys we've agreed. Donation forms. Checkout flows. Booking systems. Contact pages.

They're not hunting for edge cases. They're just trying to do normal things.

One tester told us recently:

> "I've been using the internet for 20 years. I know when a site doesn't want me there."

Another, after trying to navigate a higher education website:

> "I rely on keyboard navigation due to my motor disability. I couldn't see which element had focus. I was essentially navigating blind, counting tab presses and guessing where I was on the page."

We pay every tester for their time. And every project helps fund MyVision's wider work.

We're running a session in January where we'll walk through some real examples – what the automated scan said vs what users actually experienced.
