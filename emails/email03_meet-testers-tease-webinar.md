Subject: The disabled testers behind MyAccess
Preheader: We pay local disabled people to test real journeys using assistive tech.

Hi {{first_name}},

I’ve talked a bit about *what* MyAccess is. I’d like to say a word about **who** is behind it.

When we test a site, we don’t simulate disabilities.  
We work with **real blind and disabled users** who:

- Use screen readers like JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver every day  
- Rely on magnification, large print and high-contrast settings  
- Navigate entirely by keyboard where a mouse isn’t practical  
- Manage their lives online – banking, shopping, booking appointments

For each project, we bring together **8–10 disabled testers** and pay them to run through agreed journeys on a real site.

They’re not looking for obscure edge cases. They’re simply trying to:

- Find a service and enquire  
- Donate or join  
- Book an appointment  
- Check out and pay

Their feedback is often blunt, sometimes surprising, and always rooted in reality.

One tester told us recently:

> "I've been using the internet for 20 years. I know when a site doesn't want me there. This one didn't want me there."

That kind of feedback cuts through. It's harder to ignore than a line in a compliance report.

We then turn that into something your clients and your team can use:

- User quotes and examples for stakeholders  
- A structured backlog for your designers and developers  
- A clear story for you to tell in future proposals

Every project provides **paid work** for our disabled testers, and helps MyVision continue supporting people living with sight loss across Oxfordshire.

### Want to see how this looks in practice?

In mid-January we’re running a **live webinar** where we’ll:

- Walk through a real user journey tested by disabled users  
- Compare automated findings with lived experience  
- Show how agencies are using this in pitches and tenders

If you’d like to be the first to hear when registration opens (and get the recording even if you can’t make it live):

👉 **[Register your interest for the January webinar]({{webinar_early_interest_link}})**

I’ll send full details and the registration link once we’ve confirmed the exact date.

Best wishes,  
**Mark**
