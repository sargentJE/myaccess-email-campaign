Subject: Quick reminder – January session
Preheader: What 8 disabled users found on a "fully accessible" site

Hi {{first_name}},

Happy new year.

Quick reminder about our session later this month on accessibility testing.

We've been testing sites with real disabled users – screen reader users, keyboard-only users, people with motor impairments, people with cognitive differences – and comparing what they find to what the automated tools report.

The gaps are often surprising.
