Subject: The accessibility gap Lighthouse won't show you
Preheader: What 8 disabled users found on a "fully accessible" site

Hi {{first_name}},

Happy new year. Hope the break was good.

Before client projects pick up again, quick reminder about our January session on accessibility testing.

Most agencies we talk to have the same problem: clients expect accessibility, but the only thing you can show them is an automated score. And deep down, you know that doesn't tell the whole story.

We've been testing sites with real disabled users – screen reader users, keyboard users, people with low vision – and comparing what they find to what the automated tools report.

The gaps are often surprising.

In the webinar, we'll walk through actual examples and show how other agencies are handling this. No jargon, no guilt trips. Just practical stuff.
