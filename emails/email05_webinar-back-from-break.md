Hi {{first_name}},

New year, new projects – and the same question from clients: "Is the site accessible?"

If your honest answer is "we run Lighthouse and fix what we can," you're not alone. But there's a better answer available – and that's what our **January webinar** is about.

Most teams we talk to want to “do better on accessibility” this year, but run into the same obstacles:

- No budget for a full-time specialist  
- Clients who are unsure what they’re paying for  
- A pile of automated reports that don’t translate cleanly into tickets

In the webinar, we’ll show you a way through that using **paid disabled user testers** and a structure designed specifically for small–mid agencies.

You’ll see how to:

- Plug disabled user testing into a £5–15k project  
- Turn findings into a clear backlog instead of a 60-page PDF  
- Talk about accessibility in proposals without terrifying clients about cost
