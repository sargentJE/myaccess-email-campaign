Subject: The donation form that scored 94 but didn't work
Preheader: She gave up after 4 minutes.

Hi {{first_name}},

I watched a blind user try to donate on a charity website last month.

She found the donate button fine. But when the form loaded, her screen reader just said "edit blank" over and over. No field labels. No idea what to type where.

She gave up after 4 minutes.

The Lighthouse accessibility score on that page? 94.

I'm Mark, Chief Executive at MyVision Oxfordshire. We're a visual impairment charity that's been around for over 170 years, and we've started running accessibility testing using real disabled users.

This pattern keeps coming up. Sites that tick all the automated boxes but fall apart when someone actually tries to use them.

Things like:
- Forms where the labels exist in the code but aren't connected to anything
- Navigation menus you can't reach without tabbing through 60 other elements
- Buttons that just announce "button" with no context

Automated tools are useful. We use them. But they can't tell you what happens when a blind person tries to complete a donation, or a keyboard user tries to checkout, or someone with low vision tries to find a phone number.

That gap is where we focus.

If you're curious what this kind of testing actually looks like, I've put together a short overview with some real examples:

No forms. No sales calls. Just a sense of what we're finding.
