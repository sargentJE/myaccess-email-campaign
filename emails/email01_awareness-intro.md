Hi {{first_name}},

We were recently working with a screen reader user who was trying to donate on a site that had "passed" its accessibility checks.

She found the donate button fine. But when the form loaded:
- No labels were announced
- The "amount" field read as "edit blank"
- The submit button just said "button" with no context

She gave up after 4 minutes.

The Lighthouse score? 94.

I'm Mark, from MyVision Oxfordshire. We've started running accessibility testing with real disabled users – screen reader users, keyboard-only users, people with motor impairments, people with cognitive differences.

Automated tools are useful – but they can't see these real-life details.

We've put some of our findings into a short overview if you're curious:
