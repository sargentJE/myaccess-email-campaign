Subject: Most “accessible” sites we test still lock disabled users out
Preheader: What happens when real disabled users try to use your clients’ sites?

Hi {{first_name}},

I’m Mark, Chief Executive at **MyVision Oxfordshire** – a local charity that’s been supporting blind and visually impaired people for over 170 years.

Over the last year, we’ve been working with agencies and organisations across the UK to test how accessible their websites really are – not just in code, but in real life.

A pattern keeps coming up:

> Sites that pass automated checks  
> still fail when disabled users try to complete simple tasks.

Last month, we watched a blind user try to donate on a site that had passed all its automated checks. She found the donate button fine. But when the form loaded, her screen reader announced "edit blank" for every field. No labels. No context. She gave up after four minutes.

The Lighthouse score? **94.**

That's not unusual. We're seeing things like:

- Forms that look fine in a report but are impossible with a screen reader  
- Navigation that “meets WCAG” but breaks when you can’t use a mouse  
- Content that’s technically compliant but overwhelming for low-vision users

It’s not that automated tools are useless – far from it. It’s just that they can’t tell you what happens when:

- A blind user tries to donate  
- A low-vision user tries to find a phone number  
- A keyboard-only user tries to complete a checkout

That’s why we’ve created **MyAccess** – our **disabled user testing service for agencies**, run by MyVision Oxfordshire.

We pay a panel of blind and disabled testers to run through real journeys using their own assistive technology, then turn what they find into reports your clients actually understand and your developers can act on.

### Why I’m emailing you

If you build or maintain sites in the £5–15k range, you’re probably already under pressure to:

- “Do accessibility properly”  
- Protect your clients from risk  
- Win work where accessibility is explicitly scored

We’ve built MyAccess to plug into that reality: realistic pricing, clear deliverables, and a social-impact story you can stand behind in tenders.

If you’re curious, the easiest next step is just to have a look at how we present findings.

No forms, no hard sell – just a concrete sense of what disabled user testing could look like for one of your clients.

Best wishes,
