Subject: What you'll actually get from the session
Preheader: 60 minutes, practical, no fluff

Hi {{first_name}},

Our accessibility session is coming up soon, so I wanted to be clear about what you'll walk away with.

In about an hour:

1. **A realistic model** for adding disabled user testing to £5-15k projects – not enterprise stuff that doesn't fit your world

2. **Actual examples** of what blind and disabled users found that tools missed (including that donation form where every field read as "edit blank")

3. **How to talk about this with clients** without scaring them about cost or making it sound complicated

4. **An outline of the pilot** we're running for agencies who want to try this on one site

We'll also show how agencies are passing the cost through as a line item rather than absorbing it. And how they're using the reports in proposals for universities, councils and charities.

This isn't about making anyone feel bad for not being perfect. It's about having a repeatable way to involve real disabled users without hiring specialists.

**Details:**
📅 Friday, 30th January
⏰ 10am – 11am
💻 Free, online

If accessibility feels like "one more thing to worry about" right now – that's exactly why we're doing this. To make it simpler.
