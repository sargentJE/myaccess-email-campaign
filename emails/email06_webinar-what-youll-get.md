Hi {{first_name}},

Our **Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients** webinar is coming up soon, so I wanted to be clear about what you’ll walk away with if you join us.

In 60 minutes, you'll get:

1. **A simple model** for adding disabled user testing to your £5–15k projects  
2. **Examples of real issues** blind and disabled users found that tools missed (like the donation form that read "edit blank" for every field – on a site with a 94 Lighthouse score)  
3. **A way to talk about accessibility** that clients understand and value  
4. **An outline of our pilot** for agencies who want to try this on a single site

We’ll show you how agencies are:

- Passing the cost through as a line item, rather than absorbing it  
- Using our reports to strengthen proposals for universities, councils and charities  
- Giving their teams clarity on “what to fix first” instead of leaving it vague

This isn’t about shaming anyone for not being perfect. It’s about giving you a practical, repeatable way to involve real disabled users – without hiring an internal team.
