Subject: Last shout on the pilot
Preheader: {{pilot_slots}} spots left before {{pilot_end_date}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick follow-up – I know how fast things move once the year gets going.

We're keeping the pilot small so we can give each agency proper attention. That means we've got space for **{{pilot_slots}} more** between now and {{pilot_end_date}}.

If any of these sound familiar:

- "Clients expect us to be on top of accessibility but we're not sure where to start"
- "We run Lighthouse, but we'd like something more concrete to show people"
- "We want to do right by disabled users without building a whole new capability"

...this is a low-risk way to try it on one site.

You'd get:
- Real feedback from 8-10 disabled users
- A clear list of what to fix first
- A social impact story you can use in future proposals

Even if you decide it's not for you afterwards, you'll have made one site genuinely more accessible. And you'll have something concrete to point to.

No pitch, no pressure. Just a look at whether this fits a current project.

Or reply with "not now, keep me posted" and I'll check back in a few months.
