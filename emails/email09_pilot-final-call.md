Subject: Quick follow-up on the pilot
Preheader: A few spots left

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick follow-up – I know how fast things move once the year gets going.

We're keeping the pilot small so we can give each agency proper attention. We've got space for a few more.

You'd get:
- Real feedback from 8-10 disabled users
- A clear list of what to fix first
- A social impact story you can use in future proposals

Even if you decide it's not for you afterwards, you'll have made one site genuinely more accessible.

Or reply with "not now, keep me posted" and I'll check back in a few months.
