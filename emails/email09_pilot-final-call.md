Subject: Final call: pilot disabled user testing on one of your sites
Preheader: A simple way to make accessibility real for one client this year.

Hi {{first_name}},

A quick follow-up, because I know how fast things move once the year gets going.

We’re keeping the initial **MyAccess pilot** intentionally small so we can give each agency proper attention. That means we only have space for **{{pilot_slots}} pilots** between now and {{pilot_end_date}}.

If you’ve been thinking:

- “Our clients expect us to be on top of accessibility, but we’re not sure where to start”, or  
- “We already run Lighthouse/axe, but we’d like something more concrete to show clients”, or  
- “We want to do the right thing by disabled users without building a whole new team”

…then this is a straightforward way to try it on **one site** and see how it fits your workflow.

You’ll get:

- Real feedback from 8–10 disabled users  
- A clear plan of what to fix first  
- A social-impact story you can reuse in future proposals

And if you decide it's not for you after that, you'll still have made one of your sites significantly more accessible – and you'll have a concrete story to tell future clients.

Or hit reply with **“Not now, but keep me updated”** if you’d like us to stay in touch without any pressure.

Best,  
**Mark**
