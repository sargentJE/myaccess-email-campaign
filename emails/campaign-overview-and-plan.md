# Email Campaign – December to January

## What we're trying to do

Get cold UK web agencies to:
1. Come to the webinar on Friday, 30th January (10am – 11am)
2. Book a call to try a pilot

The pilot is the bridge to longer-term work.

## Who we're emailing

Small-to-mid UK agencies (2-100 people) building sites in the £5-15k range.

We want: founders, MDs, heads of design/UX, tech leads, senior PMs.

Most of these are cold – they've never heard of MyVision or MyAccess.

## Why MyWeb Access

What makes this different from automated tools, lone consultants, or DIY accessibility:

**1. Real disabled users as evidence**
Agencies can say: "We paid 10+ disabled users to test your site. Here's what happened." That's more believable than a Lighthouse score.

**2. Reports that work for agencies**
Four deliverables: Executive Summary (board-ready), User Validation Pack (quotes and clips), Technical Implementation Guide (dev-ready), 90-Day Roadmap with KPIs.

**3. Automation + manual testing together**
We run the automated scans and map them to what users actually experienced. Automated tools miss over 70% of real-world barriers – we catch what they miss.

**4. No need to build a team**
Repeatable service, attachable to any project. Our consultants can ghost on discovery or pitch calls as your in-house accessibility lead.

**5. Agency portal**
One login for all audited sites. Switch views, filter issues, export, track progress.

**6. Pricing for £5-15k projects**
Fixed, clear, can be passed through to clients.

**7. Social impact with credibility**
Run by a visual impairment charity (150+ years). Testers are paid. Each project funds MyVision's wider work. Demonstrable CSR story for pitches.

## Voice

From Mark Upton, Chief Executive, MyVision Oxfordshire.

Warm, direct, not corporate. More like a peer conversation than a sales pitch.

Lead with the service value. Back it up with the charity angle.

## The email sequence

**Note:** The sequence now includes Email 10 (case study follow-up, sent 10-14 days post-webinar) and a monthly nurture template for ongoing engagement with non-converters.

### Phase 1: Awareness (Dec 1-15)

**Email 1** – The problem: sites that pass checks but fail users
**Email 2** – Automation vs disabled users: why both matter
**Email 3** – Who the testers are + first webinar mention

### Phase 2: Webinar promo (Dec 18 – mid-Jan)

**Email 4** – Main webinar invite (date, time, agenda)
**Email 5** – Post-holiday reminder (early Jan)
**Email 6** – What you'll get from the session
**Email 7** – Last chance (day or two before)

### Phase 3: Conversion (after webinar)

**Email 8** – Thanks + replay + pilot details
**Email 9** – Final nudge

### Phase 4: Ongoing

**Email 10** – Case study follow-up (10-14 days after webinar)
**Monthly nurture** – One quick find per month, no hard sell

## Handling objections

"We don't have budget"
- Sized for £5-15k projects, not enterprise retainers
- Can be passed through as a line item
- Often becomes profit-neutral or positive

"Clients won't pay for this"
- Works well for tenders (especially public sector, universities, charities)
- Clear deliverable they can see
- Competitive advantage vs agencies with just automated tools
