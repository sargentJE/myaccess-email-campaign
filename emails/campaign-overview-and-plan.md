# MyAccess Email Marketing Campaign – December to Mid-January

## 1. Campaign Goal

**Ultimate goal:**  
Turn small–mid sized UK web agencies into long-term MyAccess partners, committing to regular disabled user testing across their projects.

**Immediate goal of this campaign:**  
Get cold agencies to:
1. Attend a January webinar introducing MyAccess and disabled user testing.
2. Book a discovery call to join a **one-site MyAccess pilot**, which is the bridge to longer-term partnership.

---

## 2. Target Audience

- **Who:** Small–mid sized web development / digital agencies in the UK.
- **Roles:** Agency owners, directors, heads of design/UX, senior engineers, project/delivery leads – anyone with decision-making authority.
- **Project size:** Typical website build value ~£5–15k.
- **Awareness level:**
  - Likely familiar with “accessibility” as a concept.
  - Typically using automated tools (Lighthouse, axe, WAVE) to demonstrate basic due diligence.
  - Mostly *cold* contacts who haven’t worked with MyVision/MyAccess before.

---

## 3. Positioning & Differentiation

**Core positioning:**  
> MyAccess is a specialist **disabled user testing service for agencies**, run by visual-impairment charity **MyVision Oxfordshire**.

Compared to automated tools, lone consultants, or DIY accessibility efforts, MyAccess offers:

1. **Real disabled users as evidence clients believe**
   - Agencies can say: “We paid 8–10 disabled users to test your key journeys; here’s what happened” – far more persuasive than a Lighthouse score.
   - Ideal for tenders, board presentations, and stakeholder communication.

2. **Reports tailored to agencies (sales + PM + dev)**
   - Two-layer report:
     - Business/stakeholder summary (impact, risk, user quotes, priorities).
     - Developer/UX view (grouped by template/component, with suggested fixes).
   - Backlog-ready issue list that slots into Jira/Linear/Trello.

3. **Integrated automated + manual testing**
   - Automated scans filtered and mapped to real user impact.
   - Agencies don’t need deep internal WCAG expertise to interpret findings.

4. **Capacity and continuity without building a full team**
   - Repeatable service, attachable to any project.
   - Consistent testing approach across clients and projects.

5. **Agency portal for multi-site management**
   - One login to view all audited sites.
   - Switch between stakeholder and developer report views.
   - Filter issues by severity, component, journey, or WCAG theme.
   - Track progress over time and across projects.
   - Instant access to reports, exports, and summaries.

6. **Pricing that fits £5–15k website projects**
   - Fixed, realistic pricing that can be passed through as a line item or upsell.
   - Accessibility becomes cost-neutral or even profit-positive.

7. **Genuine social impact story**
   - Run by a specialist visual impairment charity.
   - Disabled testers are paid for their time.
   - Each project helps fund frontline services, giving agencies a credible CSR/ESG story for tenders.

8. **Support beyond the report**
   - Debrief calls, optional retests, and light training.
   - Helps agencies land fixes and prevent repeated patterns.

## 4. Tone, Voice & Sender

**Sender:**  
- Emails come from **Mark Upton, Chief Executive, MyVision Oxfordshire**.

**Tone & voice:**  
- Warm, human, and slightly conversational.
- Straight-talking expert peer (not corporate, not overly “salesy”).
- Gentle challenger (“Most ‘accessible’ sites we test still lock disabled users out”).  
- Avoid obvious AI wording; keep sentences natural, specific, and grounded.
- Lead with **service value**, backed by the **charity and social impact** angle.

**Perspective that must be visible throughout:**
- Charity-led purpose (MyVision Oxfordshire as a visual-impairment charity).
- Disabled user testing at the core of the service.
- Disabled testers are **paid** for their work.
- Real-world accessibility and ethical responsibility, not just compliance.

---

## 5. Pilot Offer – What Agencies Receive

The email campaign ultimately drives agencies towards a **one-site MyAccess pilot**.

**Pilot scope:**
- One focus website (typically a key client site or the agency’s own).
- 1–2 critical user journeys tested end-to-end.
- 8–10 disabled user testers with a mix of:
  - Screen reader users (JAWS/NVDA/VoiceOver)
  - Low-vision users (magnification, large print, high contrast)
  - Keyboard-only / motor-impaired users where appropriate
- Baseline automated scan of key templates.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Scoping call (30–45 mins):**
   - Choose the website and 1–2 critical journeys.
   - Identify key page templates/components.
   - Outcome: short written test plan agreed by all.

2. **Testing by 8–10 disabled users:**
   - Testers attempt the agreed journeys on real devices.
   - Record barriers, confusion points, and workarounds.
   - Capture quotes and concrete examples.

3. **Automated scan baseline & integration:**
   - Run automated tools across key pages.
   - De-duplicate and align findings with user experience.
   - Outcome: combined view of tool findings + lived experience.

4. **Full access to the MyAccess agency portal:**
   - One portal login for the pilot website.
   - Ability to:
     - View audits and tested websites.
     - Switch between stakeholder and developer views.
     - Filter issues by severity, area of site, user journey, and WCAG themes.
     - Download reports, issue lists, and summary snapshots.

5. **Two-layer report (agency-ready):**
   - **Business / stakeholder summary:**
     - Plain-language overview of how well journeys work.
     - Key risks, top 5–10 issues, real user quotes.
     - Quick wins to demonstrate fast progress.
   - **Developer & UX view:**
     - Issues grouped by template/component.
     - Includes “what’s wrong”, who is affected, how, suggested remediation, priority and effort.
     - Structured so items can be dropped straight into project management tools.

6. **Prioritised remediation roadmap:**
   - Clear roadmap for making tested journeys meaningfully accessible.
   - Split into:
     - Fix now (next sprint)
     - Plan next (2–3 sprints)
     - Consider on redesign
   - Avoids “boil the ocean”; focuses on real impact.

7. **Live debrief & Q&A (45–60 mins):**
   - Walkthrough with PMs, dev leads, designers and account managers.
   - Explains key findings, the roadmap, and how to frame results for the end client.
   - Allows technical and commercial questions.

8. **Social impact / CSR summary:**
   - One-page summary with:
     - Number of disabled testers involved.
     - Hours of paid work created.
     - How the project supported MyVision’s services.
   - Reusable in tenders and “About our process” material.

## 7. Objection Handling Strategy

Key anticipated objections:

1. “We don’t have budget for this right now.”  
2. “Our clients won’t pay extra for accessibility.”

**How the campaign addresses them:**

- Emphasise that MyAccess is **priced for £5–15k builds**, not enterprise retainers.
- Frame cost as:
  - A small fraction of project budget.
  - A pass-through line item to clients.
  - A profit-neutral or positive service line over time.
- Show **business upside**:
  - Stronger tenders (especially public sector, universities, charities).
  - Reduced risk and clearer evidence of due diligence.
  - Competitive differentiation compared to agencies using only automated tools.
- Emphasise **ethical + social impact** without guilt:
  - Paid work for disabled testers.
  - Supporting a local charity’s services.

---

## 8. Assets & Links Used in the Campaign

The campaign assumes the existence of:

- **Webinar registration page:** `{{webinar_link}}`
- **Call / pilot booking link:** `{{booking_link}}`
- **MyAccess information / overview page:** `{{myaccess_overview_link}}`
- **Sample report or example findings:** `{{sample_report_link}}` – Use one of your existing sample reports; select a clear, anonymised example that shows both stakeholder and developer views
- **Agency portal demo/preview:** `{{portal_demo_link}}` – Either a video walkthrough or a sandbox login
- **Early interest / pre-registration form for webinar (optional):** `{{webinar_early_interest_link}}`

These are represented as placeholders in the email copy so URLs can be dropped in later.

### Sample Reports Available

You have multiple sample reports ready to share. When choosing which to use:
- Pick one that shows a clear "before" picture (issues found)
- Ensure it's properly anonymised
- Ideally shows both the stakeholder summary and developer detail views
- Include at least one concrete user quote for impact

## 9. How to Use / Adapt This Campaign

- Drop each email into your HTML / email builder and adjust formatting to match MyVision brand.
- Replace all `{{...}}` placeholders with the correct links and details.
- Tweak specific references to “this year” / “next year” to match the actual date range.
- Once the January webinar has passed, recycle Emails 1–3 and 8–9 into an evergreen cold → call sequence, replacing the live webinar references with a "watch the webinar recording" CTA.

---

## 10. Post-Campaign Nurture Strategy

For contacts who engaged but didn't convert to a pilot:

### "Keep Me Updated" List

- Anyone who replied with "not now" or similar goes into a low-touch nurture track.
- Monthly touchpoint: 1 email with a useful insight, case study snippet, or accessibility tip.
- No hard sell – purely relationship maintenance.

### Quarterly Re-engagement

Every 3 months, send a "checking in" email:
- Share a new anonymised case study or finding.
- Mention any new features (e.g. portal updates, new tester profiles).
- Soft CTA: "If timing is better now, we'd love to chat."

### Trigger-Based Re-engagement

Set up automated follow-ups when:
- A contact revisits the website (if tracking is enabled).
- New content is published (e.g. blog post, case study, webinar recording).
- Seasonal moments (e.g. "Starting Q2 projects? Here's how to build in accessibility.").

### Webinar Recording as Evergreen Asset

- Host the recording on a gated or ungated page.
- Use it as the centrepiece of the evergreen email sequence.
- Reference it in LinkedIn posts periodically ("Missed our session? Watch the replay.").
