Subject: One thing from this month
Preheader: A quick accessibility find

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick one – we tested a checkout flow last week where the "Pay Now" button just announced "button" to screen reader users. No context, no amount, nothing.

The user had no idea what they were about to do.

The automated scan said it was fine.

That's it. Just wanted to share.

If you ever want to chat about adding this kind of testing to a project, I'm around.

**Notes for future sends:**

Rotate the example each month. Keep it short – one real issue, no hard sell.

**Example bank:**

- Checkout button that just said "button" (no context)
- Navigation menu that required 60+ tabs to reach
- Form labels present in HTML but not connected to fields
- Focus indicators that passed checks but were invisible on the colour scheme
- Error messages that appeared visually but weren't announced to screen readers
- Skip link that was present but didn't do anything
- Dropdown menu where screen reader couldn't tell if it was open or closed

**Format:**
- 3-4 sentences describing the issue
- What the automated scan said
- One line: "If you ever want to chat..."
- No CTA link unless they ask

**Cadence:** Monthly, sent mid-month to avoid start-of-month inbox competition.

```
