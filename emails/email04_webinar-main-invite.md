Subject: What disabled users find that tools miss
Preheader: Free session for agencies, January

Hi {{first_name}},

Remember the donation form with the 94 Lighthouse score that a blind user couldn't complete?

We're running a free session in January where we'll show exactly what happened – the automated report vs the real user experience, side by side.

**Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients**

📅 Friday, 30th January
⏰ 10am – 11am
💻 Online, free

You'll see:
- Real examples of where automated tools said "pass" but users got stuck
- How we run tests with 8-10 disabled users
- A practical model for adding this to £5-15k projects

👉 **[Save your spot]({{webinar_link}})**

Can't make the time? Register anyway and we'll send the recording.

Mark
