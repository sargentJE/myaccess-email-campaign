Subject: Live session: what disabled users find that tools miss
Preheader: See how agencies are using disabled user testing to win and keep better clients.

Hi {{first_name}},

What happens when a site scores 94 on Lighthouse, but a blind user can't complete a simple donation?

We'll show you – live – in our January session.

### Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients  
**Live webinar with MyVision Oxfordshire**

**Date:** {{webinar_date}}  
**Time:** {{webinar_time}}  
**Format:** 40 minutes + 20 minutes Q&A  
**Cost:** Free

In this session, we’ll:

1. Walk through a real user journey tested by blind and disabled people  
2. Show how the automated report compares with what users actually experienced  
3. Share how agencies are weaving MyAccess into their delivery and tenders  
4. Explain the pilot we’re running for small–mid agencies in early 2025

You’ll see:

- How 8–10 disabled users actually test a site  
- The kind of report and remediation plan you’d receive  
- How to talk about this with your clients without scaring them

---

### Who this is for

- Agency owners and directors  
- Heads of UX, design and development  
- Delivery leads and project managers  
- In-house teams working with external agencies

If you build sites in the £5–15k bracket and want a practical way to make accessibility real – without building an internal accessibility department – this will be useful.

Best,
