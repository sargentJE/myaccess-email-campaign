Subject: What disabled users find that tools miss
Preheader: Free session for agencies, January

Hi {{first_name}},

Remember the donation form with the 94 Lighthouse score that a blind user couldn't complete?

We're running a free session in January where we'll show exactly what happened – the automated report vs the real user experience, side by side.

**Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients**

📅 {{webinar_date}}
⏰ {{webinar_time}}
💻 Online, about an hour

What we'll cover:
- Real examples of where automated tools said "pass" but users got stuck
- How we run tests with 8-10 disabled users
- A practical model for adding this to £5-15k projects
- How agencies are using this in tenders and proposals

This isn't a sales pitch dressed as a webinar. It's the stuff we've learned from running these tests and what works when you're trying to actually help clients rather than just tick boxes.

**Who it's for:**
- Agency owners and directors
- Heads of design/UX/development
- Project and delivery leads

👉 **[Save your spot]({{webinar_link}})**

Can't make the time? Register anyway and we'll send the recording.

Mark
