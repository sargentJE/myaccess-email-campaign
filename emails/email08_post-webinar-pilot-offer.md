Subject: The pilot we mentioned
Preheader: Try this on one site

Hi {{first_name}},

Thanks for joining the session – whether you caught it live or you're watching the recording.

As promised, here's what the pilot includes:

**For one site (yours or a client's):**

✅ Scoping call to pick 1-2 key journeys
✅ 8-10 disabled testers using real assistive tech
✅ Combined automated + manual findings
✅ Agency portal access with stakeholder and developer views
✅ Prioritised remediation plan
✅ Live debrief with your team

Every tester is paid. Every project funds our wider charity work.

If you want to talk through whether this fits a current project:

👉 **[Book a 15-minute call]({{booking_link}})**

Or just reply with a couple of times that work for you.

Mark
