Preheader: A structured way to try disabled user testing on a single client site.

Hi {{first_name}},

Thanks for being part of our **Accessibility That Actually Helps Your Clients** session – whether you caught it live or are watching the recording.

If you saw the donation form example (Lighthouse score 94, but every field read as "edit blank"), you'll understand why we believe disabled user testing fills a gap that automation can't.

As promised, here are the details of the **MyAccess pilot** we're offering to a small number of agencies over the next few months.

---

### What the pilot includes

For one client website (or your own agency site), you get:

1. A **30–45 minute scoping call** to pick 1–2 critical journeys  
2. **8–10 disabled user testers** (screen reader, low-vision, magnifier, keyboard-only) running those journeys on real devices  
3. A baseline **automated scan**, joined up with what users experienced  
4. **Full access to the MyAccess agency portal** for that site:
   - View findings in stakeholder or developer mode
   - Filter by severity, component, journey, or WCAG theme
   - Export issues straight to Jira, Trello, or your preferred tool
   - Track remediation progress over time
5. A **two-layer report**: business/stakeholder view + developer/UX view  
6. A **prioritised remediation plan** and backlog-ready issue list  
7. A **live debrief session with Q&A** for your team  
8. A one-page **social impact summary** you can use in proposals

Every tester is paid for their time, and your project helps fund our wider work supporting people living with sight loss.

### “We don’t have budget / our clients won’t pay extra”

That’s exactly why we’ve sized this for £5–15k projects:

- Clear, fixed pricing that you can pass through as a line item  
- A deliverable your client can see and understand  
- A story you can tell future clients:  
  > “We work with a visual impairment charity and pay disabled testers to review key journeys on your site.”

If you’d like to talk through whether this would fit one of your current or upcoming projects:

Or just reply to this email with a couple of times that work for you, and we’ll set something up.

Best wishes,  
**Mark**
