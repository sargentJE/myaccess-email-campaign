Subject: The pilot we mentioned
Preheader: Try this on one site and see how it fits

Hi {{first_name}},

Thanks for joining the session – whether you caught it live or you're watching the recording.

If you saw the donation form example (Lighthouse 94, every field "edit blank"), you'll get why we think disabled user testing fills a gap automation can't.

As promised, here's what the pilot includes:

**For one site (yours or a client's):**

- 30-45 min scoping call to pick 1-2 key journeys
- Testing by 8-10 disabled users (screen reader, low vision, keyboard-only)
- Automated scan of key pages, mapped to what users found
- Agency portal access – filter by severity/component, export to Jira/Trello
- Two-layer report – stakeholder view + developer view
- Prioritised fix list
- Live debrief with your team (45-60 mins)
- Social impact summary for proposals

Every tester is paid. Every project funds our wider charity work.

"We don't have budget for this" is the usual concern.

That's why we've priced it for £5-15k projects. Clear, fixed, passable as a line item to clients.

And the story you get to tell is: "We work with a visual impairment charity and pay disabled users to test key journeys."

That's a different proposition from "we ran Lighthouse."

If you want to talk through whether this fits a current project:

👉 **[Book a 15-minute scoping call]({{booking_link}})**

No pitch. We'll look at a current project and see if there's a fit.

Or just reply with a couple of times that work for you.

Mark
