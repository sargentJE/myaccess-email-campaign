# MyAccess Launch Campaign

This is the marketing campaign for MyAccess – our disabled user testing service at MyVision Oxfordshire. We're targeting UK web agencies who build sites in the £5-15k range.

The whole thing runs over about 6 weeks (December into mid-January) and centres on a webinar.

## The gist

Most sites that "pass" accessibility checks still don't work for disabled people. We've seen it over and over – Lighthouse says 94, but a blind user can't complete a simple donation form.

MyAccess fixes that by getting actual disabled users to test sites. We pay them properly, the reports are agency-ready, and agencies get a credible story for tenders.

This campaign is about getting that message to agencies who don't know us yet.
