## The gist

Most sites that "pass" accessibility checks still don't work for disabled people. Automated scans miss over 70% of real-world barriers. We've seen it over and over – Lighthouse says 94, but a blind user can't complete a simple donation form.

MyWeb Access fixes that by getting actual disabled users to test sites. We have 10+ disabled specialists using their own assistive tech, we pay them properly, the reports are agency-ready, and agencies get a credible story for tenders.

This campaign is about getting that message to agencies who don't know us yet.
