3 things automated tools can't see that disabled users spot in 30 seconds:

1. Focus indicators that technically exist but are invisible on your colour scheme
2. Forms that "have labels" but announce nothing useful to a screen reader
3. Navigation that's "keyboard accessible" but requires 47 tabs to reach the main content

Tools check the code. Users check the experience.

(We found all three of these on a single site last month. The agency had no idea.)

We combine both at MyWeb Access.

## Notes

- List format performs well on LinkedIn
- Each point is a real issue we've found
- The parenthetical adds social proof without being salesy
