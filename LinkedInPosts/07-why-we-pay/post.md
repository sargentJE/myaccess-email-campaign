## Post Copy

A question we sometimes get:

"Do your testers volunteer?"

No. We pay every disabled tester for their time.

During a recent test, one of our testers reached a product comparison page. The images had alt text like "image1" and "product-photo-final.jpg".

She couldn't tell which product was which. She couldn't complete the task.

That's the kind of thing our testers find. And spotting it takes knowledge, focus, and years of lived experience.

That's expertise. And expertise deserves payment.

We'll talk more about this in our January webinar → [link]
