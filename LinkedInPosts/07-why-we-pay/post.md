## Post Copy

A question we sometimes get:

"Do your testers volunteer?"

No. We pay every disabled tester for their time.

During a recent test, one of our testers reached a section with product icons. Her screen reader just said "image" for each one. No description. No context.

She couldn't tell what the icons meant. She couldn't complete the comparison.

That's the kind of thing our testers find. Spotting it takes knowledge, focus, and years of lived experience.

That's expertise. And expertise deserves payment.

We'll talk more about this in our January webinar → [link]
