## Post Copy

A question we sometimes get:

"Do your testers volunteer?"

No. We pay every disabled tester for their time.

Why?
- Their expertise has value
- Testing is real work
- Too many "accessibility" initiatives rely on unpaid labour from disabled people

Every MyAccess project creates paid work and funds our wider services.

We'll talk more about this in our January webinar → [link]
