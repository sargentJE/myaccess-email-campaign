## Post Copy

A question we sometimes get:

"Do your testers volunteer?"

No. We pay every disabled tester for their time.

Last week, one of our testers flagged alt text that read "image_2847.jpg" on a product photo. That one line of feedback? It took knowledge, focus, and years of lived experience to know why it mattered.

That's expertise. And expertise deserves payment.

Every MyWeb Access project creates paid work for disabled people and funds our wider charity services.

We'll talk more about this in our January webinar → [link]
