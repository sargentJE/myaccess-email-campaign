## Post Copy

Here's something we found last month:

A navigation menu that looked fine. Worked fine with a mouse.

But when a keyboard user pressed Tab?
- Focus jumped past the menu entirely
- The only way to reach it was to Tab through 60+ elements
- Most users gave up

The automated scan? "All interactive elements are keyboard accessible." ✅

We'll be walking through examples like this in our January webinar.

## Notes

- Real example that creates curiosity
- Bridges to webinar registration
- Shows the gap between automated pass and real-world fail
