## Post Copy

When we pay disabled testers to walk through a site, we're not just finding issues.

We're creating paid work for people who are often excluded from the job market.

Every project funds our wider work supporting people living with sight loss across Oxfordshire.

That's accessibility with purpose.

## Notes

- Shorter post to let the message land
- No CTA needed; brand/values building
