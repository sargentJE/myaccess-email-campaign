## Post Copy

We're working with a small group of agencies to run one-site pilots.

What's included:
✅ Scoping call to pick 1–2 key journeys
✅ 8–10 disabled testers using real assistive tech
✅ Combined automated + manual findings
✅ Agency portal access with stakeholder and developer views
✅ Prioritised remediation plan
✅ Live debrief with your team

If you've been thinking "we should do something about accessibility" – this is a low-risk way to start.
