## Post Copy

3 things agencies took away from our disabled user testing webinar:

1. **Tools check code. People check experience.** Scans catch a lot, but they miss the context and confusion that real users hit every day.

2. **Real users = real credibility.** "We paid disabled people to test your site" is a much better story than a Lighthouse score.

3. **You don't need an in-house team.** A service you can plug into your workflow is enough.
