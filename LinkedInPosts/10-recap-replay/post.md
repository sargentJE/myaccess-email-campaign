## Post Copy

3 things agencies took away from our disabled user testing webinar:

1. **Tools check code, users check experience.** Automated scans are useful – but they miss context, confusion, and workarounds.

2. **"We paid disabled users to test your site" wins tenders.** It's a more powerful story than a Lighthouse score.

3. **You don't need an internal accessibility team.** A repeatable service that plugs into your existing workflow is enough.
