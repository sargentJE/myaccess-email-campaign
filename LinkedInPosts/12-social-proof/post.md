# LinkedIn Post 12: Social Proof / Case Angle

**Phase:** 3 – Post-Webinar & Pilot (Week 6)  
**Suggested day:** End of week  
**Image:** None required (text-only post)

## Post Copy

After one pilot, an agency told us:

"We used the report in our next tender. The client specifically mentioned it as a differentiator."

That's the goal: make accessibility something you can *show*, not just claim.

If you'd like to try this on one client site, we're running limited pilots now.

Details: [link] or DM me.

## Image

No image for this post – testimonial/quote posts often work better as text-only.

Alternatively, create a simple quote graphic with the testimonial.

## Notes

- Social proof is powerful at the conversion stage
- Keep the quote short and specific
- "Limited pilots" creates gentle urgency
- Multiple response options (link or DM)
