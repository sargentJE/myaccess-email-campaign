## Post Copy

"Our forms are accessible – we added labels."

We hear this a lot.

Then we watch a screen reader user try to complete the form:
- The label says "Name" but it's not programmatically linked
- The screen reader announces "edit blank"
- The user has no idea what information to enter

Labels need to be *connected*, not just present.

This is the kind of thing our disabled testers catch in minutes.
